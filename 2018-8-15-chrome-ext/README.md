Write a Google Chrome extension that adds a modal dialog to any web page whenever the query parameter `?opengraph=true` is present in the address bar. The contents of the modal should show the OpenGraph metadata (if present) on the page.

Example page with Open Graph [Rotten Tomatoes page](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avataropengraph=true) for the movie Avatar

Where To Start:
---------------
 - [Chrome Extensions in 2018](https://checklyhq.com/blog/2018/08/creating-a-chrome-extension-in-2018-the-good-the-bad-and-the-meh/)
 - the [Chrome Extension Developer's Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devguide)
 - Facebook [OpenGraph Markup Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters#markup)
 - Facebook [OpenGraph Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
 - the [Facebook Pixel Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc?hl=en) Chrome Extension - this is a good example of a Chrome extension that reads data from the page but doesn't do exactly what this task is.

Bonus:
---
 - publish your extension (if you're already a registered Google Developer)

Deliverables
------------
Clone this repository and write code in your own github account. Edit this `README.md` file with instructions on how to execute whatever code you write. It should work as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). Send us a link to your completed code when finished.
